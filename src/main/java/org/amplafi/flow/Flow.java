/**
 * defines a definition of a flow or a specific flow.
 *
 * <p>
 * Flows consist of FlowActivities. FlowActivities can be shared across
 * instances of Flows.
 * <p>
 * FlowActivities can create new objects. However it is the responsibility of
 * the Flow to determine if the object created by FlowActivities should be
 * actually persisted. (i.e. committed to the database.)
 * <p>
 * Flows are also responsible for connecting relationships. A FlowActivity may
 * create a relationship object but it will not be aware of the endpoints of
 * that relationship (a FlowActivity is not aware of the Flow nor its
 * history/state.)
 * <p>
 * Flows should not keep references to objects that FlowActivities create or
 * retrieve. The FlowActivity is responsible for that. This is important if a
 * FlowActivity is shared amongst Flow instances.

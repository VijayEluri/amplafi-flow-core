/**
 *
 * EXPERIMENTAL -- I am exploring what/how scope should be used and is it really needed? Or does PropertyUsage do a good job?
 * Need more thinking and explicit explanation of how to use PropertyScope/ {@link PropertyUsage}.
 *
 * PropertyScope is really scope of visibility while the flow is active.
 *
 * So property scope should NOT(? what about activityLocal? be used to determine namespace of property while the flow is active. (while active should always be in
 * the most narrow namespace?)
 *
 * However, once the flow exists, PropertyScope is used to determine where changes to the value should be copied.
 *
 * Do we really need PropertyScope?
 * how to handle initializing flowproperies when they are labeled as 'flowLocal' or 'activityLocal'
   * how should 'flowLocal'/'activityLocal' be used?
   * reason for flowlocal/activity local is to allow a common set of properties names to be reused. this allows activities to be less aware of their flow.
   * an analogy might be parameter passing in Java?
